# ADFormer

## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Currently, our paper has been submitted to TIM and is still under review. To assist the reviewers in understanding the model architecture of ADFormer, we have open-sourced the code of the ADFormer's model. As for the complete training and testing code of ADFormer, we will make it open-sourced within **one week after the paper's acceptance**. Thank you for your interest.
